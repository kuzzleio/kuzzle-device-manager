# Decoders

Each sensor model can receive a different payload, it is then necessary to decode this payload in order to retrieve the necessary information and put it in the right place in the document of the associated sensor.

To do this, it is necessary to implement a decoder by implementing the `Decoder` class.

This class must at least implement the `decode` method in order to retrieve at the right place the payload data.

A decoder is linked to a sensor model. Its registration triggers the creation of a specific API action to receive payloads from this sensor model. Each payload will be decoded by the decoder provided.

**Example:** _Decoder for the sensor model "Karakoy"_

```js
// "Karakoy" sensor payload
{
  deviceEUI: '12345',
  register55: 23.3,
  batteryLevel: 0.8,
}
```

```js
import { JSONObject, KuzzleRequest } from 'kuzzle';
import { Decoder, SensorContent, DeviceManager } from 'kuzzle-plugin-device-manager';

const deviceManager = new DeviceManager();

class KarakoyDecoder extends Decoder {
  constructor () {
    super("Karakoy");
  }

  async decode (payload: JSONObject, request: KuzzleRequest): Promise<SensorContent> {
    const sensorContent: SensorContent = {
      reference: payload.deviceEUI,
      measures: {
        temperature: {
          updatedAt: Date.now(),
          value: payload.register55,
        }
      },
      qos: {
        battery: payload.batteryLevel * 100
      }
    };

    return sensorContent;
  }
}

deviceManager.registerDecoder(new KarakoyDecoder());
```

## Receive payloads

When registering a decoder, a corresponding API action is registered in the `device-manager/payload` controller.

The API action name is the name of the model in `kebab-case`.

The generated URL is the following: `POST /_/device-manager/payload/<model-kebab-case>`.

You can specify a custom API action and customs HTTP routes by defining the `action` and `http` properties on the decoder class.

```js
class KarakoyDecoder extends Decoder {
  constructor () {
    super("Karakoy");

    // Generated API action: "device-manager/payload:karakoy-v1"
    this.action = 'karakoy-v1';

    // Generated HTTP route: PUT /_/v1/device-manager/payload/karakoy
    this.http = [
      { verb: 'put', path: 'v1/device-manager/payload/karakoy' }
    ];
  }
}
```

## Hooks 

You can then use lifecycle hooks to modify the payload during itâ€™s process

  - `validate`: Validate the payload format before processing
  - `beforeRegister`: Enrichment hook executed before registering a sensor
  - `afterRegister`: Hook executed after registering a sensor
  - `beforeUpdate`: Enrichment hook executed before updating a sensor
  - `afterUpdate`: Hook executed after updating a sensor

## Troubleshooting

Every payload received by Kuzzle will be stored in the `payloads` collection of the admin index.

Each document contains the following property:
  - `uuid`: payload unique identifier (also found in measures)
  - `valid`: payload validity
  - `sensorModel`: sensor model registered for this payload
  - `payload`: raw payload content
