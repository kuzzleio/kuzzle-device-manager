# Models

In order to model a use case, it is possible to define models of sensors and assets that will be used when creating digital twins.

Each sensor or asset is an instance of a previously defined model.

Models can be defined upstream through the backend framework but also dynamically using the API.

## Sensor Model

A sensor model contains the following information:

- `model`: model name
- `measures`: received measurements
- `decoder`: (optional) instance of a [Decoder] to normalize the data
- `metadataMappings`: (optional) metadata mappings (See [Collection Mappings](https://docs.kuzzle.io/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage/#collection-mappings))
- `defaultMetadata`: (optional) default metadata values
- `metadataDetails`: (optional) Group, translations and editor hint.
  - Group: metadata can be grouped in the display under a same title, you need to defined `metadataGroups` to use it.
  - Translations: you can use to keep consistency on translations between your apps.
  - Editor hint: it unlock fonctionnalities depending on the metadata type you define.
- `metadataGroups`: (optional) Groups list with translations for group name. You can use it to group metadatas by their concerns

It is possible to create new models on the Kuzzle IoT Platform using either:

- the API through the action `device-manager/models:writeDevice`
- the framework with the method `deviceManager.models.registerDevice`

**Example: declaration of a model via API**

```js
import {
  ApiModelWriteDeviceRequest,
  ApiModelWriteDeviceResult,
} from "kuzzle-device-manager-types";

(await sdk.query) < ApiModelWriteDeviceRequest,
  ApiModelWriteDeviceResult >
    {
      controller: "device-manager/models",
      action: "writeDevice",
      body: {
        model: "Enginko",
        measurements: [
          { name: "temperatureInternal", type: "temperature" },
          { name: "temperatureExternal", type: "temperature" },
        ],
      },
    };
```

The API also allows to:

- list available models `device-manager/models:listDevices`
- get a model `device-manager/models:getDevices`


## Measure Model

A measure model contains the following information:

- `model`: model name
- `measure`: type of the measure
- `valuesMappings`: measurements mappings (See [Collection Mappings](https://docs.kuzzle.io/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage/#collection-mappings))
- `valuesDetails`: (optional) Metadata and translations of measurements. You can use it to keep consistency on translations between your apps

It is possible to create new models on the Kuzzle IoT Platform using either:

- the API through the action `device-manager/models:writeMeasure`
- the framework with the method `deviceManager.models.registerMeasure`

**Example: declaration of a model via API**

```typescript
await sdk.query({
      controller: 'device-manager/models',
      action: 'writeMeasure',
      body: {
        type: 'light',
        valuesMappings: {
          light: { type: 'integer' },
        },
        valuesDetails: {
          light: {
            en: {
              friendlyName: 'Light intensity',
              unit: 'lux',
            },
            fr: {
              friendlyName: 'Intensit√© lumineuse',
              unit: 'lux',
            },
          },
        },
      },
    });
```

The API also allows to:

- list registered measures `device-manager/models:listMeasures`
- get a measure model `device-manager/models:getMeasure`

## Asset Model

Unlike sensors and metrics which are available for all engine groups, asset models are specific to a particular engine group.

An asset model contains the following information:

- `model`: model name
- `engineGroup`: engine group to which the model belongs.
- `measures`: received measurements
- `metadataMappings`: (optional) metadata mappings (See [Collection Mappings](https://docs.kuzzle.io/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage/#collection-mappings))
- `defaultMetadata`: (optional) default metadata values- 
- `metadataDetails`: (optional) Group, translations and editor hint.
  - Group: metadata can be grouped in the display under a same title, you need to defined `metadataGroups` to use it.
  - Translations: you can use to keep consistency on translations between your apps.
  - Editor hint: it unlock fonctionnalities depending on the metadata type you define.
- `metadataGroups`: (optional) Groups list with translations for group name. You can use it to group metadatas by their concerns
- `tooltipModels`: (optional) Tooltip model list, each containing labels and tooltip content to be shown. You can use it to create templates that displays relevant information in dashboards

It is possible to create new models on the Kuzzle IoT Platform using either:

- the API through the `device-manager/models:writeAsset` action
- the framework with the method `deviceManager/models.registerAsset`

**Example: declaration of a model via API**

```js
import {
  ApiModelWriteAssetRequest,
  ApiModelWriteAssetResult,
} from "kuzzle-device-manager-types";

(await sdk.query) < ApiModelWriteAssetRequest,
  ApiModelWriteAssetResult >
    {
      controller: "device-manager/models",
      action: "writeAsset",
      engineGroup: "asset_tracking",
      body: {
        model: "Container",
        measurements: [
          { name: "temperatureInternal", type: "temperature" },
          { name: "temperatureExternal", type: "temperature" },
        ],
      },
    };
```

The API also allows to:

- list available models `device-manager/models:listAssets`
- get a model `device-manager/models:getAssets`
